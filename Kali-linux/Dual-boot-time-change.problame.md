When dual-booting Windows 11 and Kali Linux, the time discrepancy issue often arises because Windows and Linux handle system time differently.

---

### **Cause of the Problem:**
- **Linux** typically stores system time as **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)**.
- **Windows** stores system time as **local time**.

This difference causes time settings to change when switching between the two systems.

---

### **Solutions:**

#### **Method 1: Force Windows to Use UTC**
1. **Edit the Windows Registry:**
   - Press **Windows + R**, type `regedit`, and press **Enter**.
   - Navigate to:
     ```
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation
     ```
   - Right-click in the right pane and select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
   - Name it: `RealTimeIsUniversal`.
   - Double-click the new entry and set the **Value** to `1`.
   - Restart Windows.

2. This will force Windows to use UTC, ensuring time synchronization with Linux.

#### **Method 2: Configure Linux to Use Local Time**
1. To configure Kali Linux to use **local time**, run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock
   ```
2. This makes Linux follow the same time-handling method as Windows.

### **Which Method Should You Choose?**
- **Method 1 (Modify Windows Registry)** is recommended because it avoids changing Linux's time functionalities and is easier to manage.
- If you prefer to configure Linux instead, choose **Method 2**.

### **Additional Tips:**
- Ensure that the correct time zone is set in your BIOS/UEFI settings.
- If the problem persists or you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance. ðŸ˜Š
