# 4. Linked Lists

#### **Representation of Singly Linked Lists in Memory**

- **What It Is:** A singly linked list is a way to store data where each element (called a node) points to the next element in the list. Each node has two parts:
  - **Data:** The actual value or information stored in the node.
  - **Next Pointer:** A link to the next node in the list.

- **How It Works:** Imagine a group of people standing in a line, each person holding the hand of the person next to them. The first person knows who’s next in line, and that person knows the next one, and so on. The last person doesn’t hold anyone’s hand because there’s no one after them.

- **Memory Representation:**
  - In a singly linked list, nodes are stored in memory, and each node contains the data and the address (or reference) to the next node.
  - The list starts from a "head" pointer, which points to the first node. If the list is empty, the head pointer is `null`.

#### **Algorithms for Insertion and Deletion in a Singly Linked List**

- **Insertion Algorithm (at the beginning):**
  1. Create a new node.
  2. Set the new node’s next pointer to point to the current head node.
  3. Update the head pointer to point to the new node.

  **Example in C:**
  ```c
  struct Node {
      int data;
      struct Node* next;
  };

  void insertAtBeginning(struct Node** head, int newData) {
      struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
      newNode->data = newData;
      newNode->next = *head;
      *head = newNode;
  }
  ```

- **Deletion Algorithm (from the beginning):**
  1. Check if the list is empty (head is `null`). If it is, there’s nothing to delete.
  2. Set a temporary pointer to the head node.
  3. Update the head pointer to the next node.
  4. Free the memory of the old head node.

  **Example in C:**
  ```c
  void deleteFromBeginning(struct Node** head) {
      if (*head == NULL) return; // Empty list, nothing to delete
      struct Node* temp = *head;
      *head = (*head)->next;
      free(temp);
  }
  ```

#### **What is a Doubly Linked List?**

- **Definition:** A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node has two pointers:
  - **Next Pointer:** Points to the next node.
  - **Previous Pointer:** Points to the previous node.

- **Advantages Over Singly Linked Lists:**
  - **Bidirectional Traversal:** You can move forward and backward through the list.
  - **Easier Deletion:** You can delete a node more easily since you have a pointer to the previous node.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - **More Memory:** Each node requires extra memory for the additional pointer.
  - **Complexity:** Operations like insertion and deletion are more complex because you need to update two pointers.

  **Example in C:**
  ```c
  struct DNode {
      int data;
      struct DNode* next;
      struct DNode* prev;
  };
  ```

#### **Circular Linked Lists and Their Operations**

- **What It Is:** In a circular linked list, the last node’s next pointer points back to the first node, forming a circle. This can be done in both singly and doubly linked lists.

- **Operations:**
  - **Traversal:** Start from the head and keep moving to the next node until you reach the starting node again.
  - **Insertion:** Similar to a singly linked list, but you must also update the last node’s next pointer to point to the new node (or the first node if inserting at the beginning).
  - **Deletion:** Similar to a singly linked list, but you must update the last node’s next pointer if you delete the first node.

  **Example in C (Circular Singly Linked List):**
  ```c
  struct Node {
      int data;
      struct Node* next;
  };

  void insertAtEnd(struct Node** head, int newData) {
      struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
      newNode->data = newData;
      newNode->next = *head;

      if (*head == NULL) {
          *head = newNode;
          newNode->next = newNode;
      } else {
          struct Node* temp = *head;
          while (temp->next != *head)
              temp = temp->next;
          temp->next = newNode;
      }
  }
  ```

In summary, linked lists are data structures where elements (nodes) are connected by pointers. Singly linked lists move in one direction, doubly linked lists move in both directions, and circular linked lists loop back to the start. These structures help manage data in a flexible way.
