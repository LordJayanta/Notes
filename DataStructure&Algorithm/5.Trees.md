### 5. Trees

#### **Binary Tree and Its Properties**

- **What It Is:** A binary tree is a type of data structure where each node can have at most two children. These children are referred to as the left child and the right child.

- **Properties of Binary Trees:**
  - **Root:** The topmost node in the tree.
  - **Leaf Node:** A node that has no children.
  - **Height:** The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.
  - **Depth:** The level of a node in the tree, starting from 0 at the root.

- **Example in C:**
  ```c
  struct Node {
      int data;
      struct Node* left;
      struct Node* right;
  };
  ```

#### **Operations on Binary Search Tree (BST)**

- **What It Is:** A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree where each node follows a specific order: 
  - All the nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node’s value.
  - All the nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node’s value.

- **Common Operations:**

  - **Insertion:**
    - Start from the root and compare the value to be inserted with the root.
    - If it’s smaller, go to the left subtree; if it’s larger, go to the right subtree.
    - Repeat until you find an empty spot, then insert the node.

    **Algorithm in C:**
    ```c
    struct Node* insert(struct Node* node, int data) {
        if (node == NULL) {
            struct Node* newNode = (struct Node*)malloc(sizeof(struct Node));
            newNode->data = data;
            newNode->left = newNode->right = NULL;
            return newNode;
        }

        if (data < node->data)
            node->left = insert(node->left, data);
        else
            node->right = insert(node->right, data);

        return node;
    }
    ```

  - **Deletion:**
    - If the node has no children, simply remove it.
    - If the node has one child, remove the node and link its child directly to its parent.
    - If the node has two children, find the smallest node in the right subtree (in-order successor), replace the node to be deleted with this node, and delete the in-order successor.

    **Algorithm in C:**
    ```c
    struct Node* deleteNode(struct Node* root, int data) {
        if (root == NULL) return root;

        if (data < root->data)
            root->left = deleteNode(root->left, data);
        else if (data > root->data)
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, data);
        else {
            if (root->left == NULL) {
                struct Node* temp = root->right;
                free(root);
                return temp;
            } else if (root->right == NULL) {
                struct Node* temp = root->left;
                free(root);
                return temp;
            }

            struct Node* temp = findMin(root->right);
            root->data = temp->data;
            root->right = deleteNode(root->right, temp->data);
        }

        return root;
    }
    ```

#### **What is an AVL Tree?**

- **Definition:** An AVL Tree is a type of self-balancing Binary Search Tree. In an AVL tree, the difference in heights between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1. If this difference, called the balance factor, becomes more than 1, the tree is rebalanced using rotations.

- **How It Differs from BST:**
  - A regular BST can become unbalanced if elements are inserted in a way that makes one side much deeper than the other. An AVL tree maintains its balance, ensuring that the operations (insertion, deletion, and search) remain efficient.

- **Example of Rotation in C:**
  ```c
  struct Node* rightRotate(struct Node* y) {
      struct Node* x = y->left;
      struct Node* T2 = x->right;

      x->right = y;
      y->left = T2;

      return x;
  }
  ```

#### **Applications of Binary Trees**

- **Searching:** Binary Search Trees are used to quickly find an element.
- **Sorting:** BSTs can be used to implement efficient sorting algorithms.
- **Hierarchical Data Representation:** Binary trees represent hierarchical structures like folder systems or organizational charts.

#### **B Trees and B+ Trees**

- **What They Are:**
  - **B Trees:** A B Tree is a self-balancing search tree in which nodes can have more than two children. B Trees are used in databases and file systems to keep data sorted and allow searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
  
  - **B+ Trees:** A B+ Tree is an extension of a B Tree. In a B+ Tree, all values are stored at the leaf level, and internal nodes only store keys. This makes searching and traversal more efficient, especially in databases.

- **Basic Operations:**

  - **Insertion in B Tree:**
    - Start from the root and find the appropriate leaf node to insert the key.
    - If the leaf node has space, insert the key.
    - If the leaf node is full, split it into two nodes and promote the middle key to the parent node.

    **Algorithm in Pseudocode:**
    ```
    Insert(key, node):
        if node is full:
            split(node)
        if node is a leaf:
            insert key in node
        else:
            Insert(key, appropriate child of node)
    ```

  - **Insertion in B+ Tree:**
    - Similar to B Tree but the values are always inserted in the leaf nodes.
    - If a leaf node is full, it is split, and the middle key is pushed up to the internal nodes.

- **Key Differences:**
  - **B Tree:** Data can be stored in both internal nodes and leaf nodes.
  - **B+ Tree:** Data is only stored in the leaf nodes, making it more efficient for range queries.

In summary, trees are powerful data structures for organizing data hierarchically. Binary Trees and their variants (BST, AVL) are used for efficient searching and sorting. B Trees and B+ Trees are essential for managing large amounts of data, especially in databases.
