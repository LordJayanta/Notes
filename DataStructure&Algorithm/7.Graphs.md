# 7. Graphs

#### **Basic Terminologies in Graphs**

1. **Graph**: A graph is a collection of nodes (also called vertices) and edges (lines connecting the nodes). A graph can represent various real-world situations like social networks, maps, or even schedules.

2. **Vertex (Node)**: A point in the graph where lines intersect or branch off. In a social network graph, each person can be represented as a vertex.

3. **Edge (Link)**: A line connecting two vertices in a graph. If two people are friends in a social network, there will be an edge between their vertices.

4. **Degree**: The number of edges connected to a vertex. If a person has three friends, the degree of their vertex is 3.

5. **Path**: A sequence of vertices connected by edges. It’s like finding a way from one person to another in a social network through their mutual friends.

6. **Cycle**: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edge.

7. **Connected Graph**: A graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices.

8. **Directed Graph (Digraph)**: A graph where edges have a direction, meaning they go from one vertex to another in a specific way, like one-way roads.

9. **Undirected Graph**: A graph where edges don’t have a direction, meaning the connection goes both ways, like two-way roads.

10. **Weighted Graph**: A graph where edges have weights or costs associated with them, like distances on a map.

#### **Graph Traversal Algorithms**

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - **What It Is**: BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level. It starts from a source vertex and visits all its neighbors before moving on to their neighbors.
   
   - **How It Works**:
     1. Start from the source vertex and mark it as visited.
     2. Visit all the adjacent vertices (neighbors) and add them to a queue.
     3. Dequeue a vertex from the front of the queue and visit its unvisited neighbors, adding them to the queue.
     4. Repeat until the queue is empty.
   
   - **Example in C++**:
     ```cpp
     void BFS(int startVertex) {
         std::queue<int> q;
         q.push(startVertex);
         visited[startVertex] = true;
         
         while (!q.empty()) {
             int currentVertex = q.front();
             q.pop();
             std::cout << "Visited " << currentVertex << " ";
             
             for (int i = 0; i < adjList[currentVertex].size(); i++) {
                 int adjVertex = adjList[currentVertex][i];
                 if (!visited[adjVertex]) {
                     q.push(adjVertex);
                     visited[adjVertex] = true;
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - **What It Is**: DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It goes deep into the graph until it can’t go further, then it backtracks and explores other branches.
   
   - **How It Works**:
     1. Start from the source vertex and mark it as visited.
     2. Visit the next unvisited vertex connected to the current vertex and repeat.
     3. If no adjacent unvisited vertex is found, backtrack to the previous vertex.
     4. Continue until all vertices are visited.
   
   - **Example in C++**:
     ```cpp
     void DFS(int vertex) {
         visited[vertex] = true;
         std::cout << "Visited " << vertex << " ";
         
         for (int i = 0; i < adjList[vertex].size(); i++) {
             int adjVertex = adjList[vertex][i];
             if (!visited[adjVertex]) {
                 DFS(adjVertex);
             }
         }
     }
     ```
   - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E)

#### **Complexity Analysis of Graph Search Algorithms**

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(V), for the queue and visited list.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
  - **Space Complexity**: O(V), for the recursion stack and visited list.

**Summary**: BFS is more suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, while DFS is better for tasks like topological sorting or detecting cycles. Both have similar time complexities but differ in space complexity depending on the graph’s structure.
