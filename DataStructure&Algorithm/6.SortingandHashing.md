### 6. Sorting and Hashing

#### **Sorting Algorithms: Description and Comparison**

**1. Selection Sort:**

- **What It Is:** Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm. It repeatedly finds the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part of the list and moves it to the beginning (or end).

- **How It Works:**
  1. Start with the first element and assume it's the smallest.
  2. Compare it with all other elements to find the actual smallest.
  3. Swap the smallest element with the first element.
  4. Move to the next element and repeat until the list is sorted.

- **Example in C:**
  ```c
  void selectionSort(int arr[], int n) {
      int i, j, minIdx;
      for (i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
          minIdx = i;
          for (j = i+1; j < n; j++) {
              if (arr[j] < arr[minIdx])
                  minIdx = j;
          }
          int temp = arr[minIdx];
          arr[minIdx] = arr[i];
          arr[i] = temp;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)

**2. Bubble Sort:**

- **What It Is:** Bubble Sort is another simple sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

- **How It Works:**
  1. Start at the beginning of the list.
  2. Compare the first two elements and swap them if they’re in the wrong order.
  3. Move to the next pair and repeat.
  4. After one pass, the largest element will be in its correct position.
  5. Repeat until the entire list is sorted.

- **Example in C:**
  ```c
  void bubbleSort(int arr[], int n) {
      for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
              if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                  int temp = arr[j];
                  arr[j] = arr[j+1];
                  arr[j+1] = temp;
              }
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)

**3. Insertion Sort:**

- **What It Is:** Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It picks an element from the unsorted part and places it in its correct position in the sorted part.

- **How It Works:**
  1. Start with the second element, considering the first element as sorted.
  2. Compare the second element with the first and place it in the correct position.
  3. Move to the next element and repeat.
  4. Continue until the entire list is sorted.

- **Example in C:**
  ```c
  void insertionSort(int arr[], int n) {
      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
          int key = arr[i];
          int j = i - 1;
          while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
              arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
              j = j - 1;
          }
          arr[j + 1] = key;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)

**4. Quick Sort:**

- **What It Is:** Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into two smaller sub-arrays, sorting the sub-arrays, and then combining them.

- **How It Works:**
  1. Pick a "pivot" element from the array.
  2. Partition the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
  3. Recursively apply the same process to the sub-arrays.
  4. Combine the sorted sub-arrays.

- **Example in C:**
  ```c
  int partition(int arr[], int low, int high) {
      int pivot = arr[high];
      int i = (low - 1);

      for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
          if (arr[j] < pivot) {
              i++;
              int temp = arr[i];
              arr[i] = arr[j];
              arr[j] = temp;
          }
      }
      int temp = arr[i + 1];
      arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
      arr[high] = temp;
      return (i + 1);
  }

  void quickSort(int arr[], int low, int high) {
      if (low < high) {
          int pi = partition(arr, low, high);
          quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
          quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) on average, but O(n^2) in the worst case.

**5. Merge Sort:**

- **What It Is:** Merge Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

- **How It Works:**
  1. Divide the array into two halves.
  2. Recursively sort each half.
  3. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

- **Example in C:**
  ```c
  void merge(int arr[], int l, int m, int r) {
      int n1 = m - l + 1;
      int n2 = r - m;

      int L[n1], R[n2];

      for (int i = 0; i < n1; i++)
          L[i] = arr[l + i];
      for (int j = 0; j < n2; j++)
          R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j];

      int i = 0, j = 0, k = l;
      while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
          if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
              arr[k] = L[i];
              i++;
          } else {
              arr[k] = R[j];
              j++;
          }
          k++;
      }

      while (i < n1) {
          arr[k] = L[i];
          i++;
          k++;
      }

      while (j < n2) {
          arr[k] = R[j];
          j++;
          k++;
      }
  }

  void mergeSort(int arr[], int l, int r) {
      if (l < r) {
          int m = l + (r - l) / 2;
          mergeSort(arr, l, m);
          mergeSort(arr, m + 1, r);
          merge(arr, l, m, r);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

**6. Heap Sort:**

- **What It Is:** Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It’s similar to selection sort but with a more efficient way of finding the minimum or maximum element.

- **How It Works:**
  1. Build a max heap from the input data.
  2. The largest element is at the root, swap it with the last element, and then reduce the heap size.
  3. Heapify the root.
  4. Repeat until all elements are sorted.

- **Example in C:**
  ```c
  void heapify(int arr[], int n, int i) {
      int largest = i;
      int left = 2 * i + 1;
      int right = 2 * i + 2;

      if (left < n && arr[left] > arr[largest])
          largest = left;

      if (right < n && arr[right] > arr[largest])
          largest = right;

      if (largest != i) {
          int swap = arr[i];
          arr[i] = arr[largest];
          arr[largest] = swap;

          heapify(arr, n, largest);
      }
  }

  void heapSort(int arr[], int n) {
      for (int i = n / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
          heapify(arr, n, i);

      for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
          int temp = arr[0];
          arr[0] = arr[i];
          arr[i] = temp;

          heapify(arr, i, 0);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)

#### **Concept of Hashing and Its Applications**

- **What It Is:** Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indices of an array. It uses a hash function to map keys to their associated values in a hash table.

- **How It Works:**
  - A hash function takes an input (or key) and returns an integer (hash code), which is used as an index in an array to store the corresponding value.
  - The key-value pairs are stored in a hash table where the keys are unique.

- **Applications:**
  - **Dictionary Implementation:** Used in languages like Python to quickly access data.
  - **Database Indexing:** Helps in fast data retrieval.
  - **Caching:** Storing frequently accessed data for quick retrieval.
  - **Password Storage:** Storing hashed passwords instead of plain text for
